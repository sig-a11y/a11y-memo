This document outlines NV Access’s planned development roadmap for NVDA and its supporting infrastructure. Priorities are grouped into short, medium and long-term timeframes. This roadmap will be updated to reflect completed projects, development progress and significant changes to the world of screen readers and the wider technology space.

## Short-Term Priorities

These priorities focus on enhancements and improvements that we aim to deliver in the near future.

* **MathCAT integration into core:** Integrating the MathCAT math expression reader directly into the NVDA core, providing seamless access to mathematical content.
* **ARIA compliance:** Continued improvements and updates to NVDA’s ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) support, ensuring compatibility with modern web content.
* **Braille enhancements:** Addressing known issues and improving the overall stability and reliability of braille support in NVDA.
* **Braille font attributes:** Adding support for braille font attributes, allowing for more customised and informative braille displays.
* **Updated project linting:** Updating our linting tools and rules to improve code quality and consistency across the project.
* **Optimising certification system queries:** Optimising database queries used by the NVDA certification system to improve performance and reduce latency.
* **Containerising server infrastructure:** Migrating our server infrastructure to containers, enhancing scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility.
* **Add-on Store automatic updates:** Enabling automatic updates for add-ons downloaded from the NVDA Add-on Store, ensuring users have the latest features and bug fixes.

## Medium-Term Priorities

These priorities represent significant features and improvements that require more extensive development effort.

* **Integration of NVDA Remote into core:** Migrating the functionality of the NVDA Remote add-on into NVDA’s core for enhanced functionality and security.
* **Braille multi-line prototype:** Development of a prototype for multi-line braille display support, exploring new ways to present information in braille.
* **Enhanced Excel UIA support:** Improvements to NVDA’s UIA (User Interface Automation) support for Microsoft Excel, providing a more robust and intuitive experience for navigating and interacting with spreadsheets.
* **Support for Microsoft Natural Voices:** Adding support for Microsoft’s Natural Voices text-to-speech engine, expanding user choice and providing access to high-quality synthetic voices.
* **Web front end for Add-on Store:** Creating a web-based front end for the NVDA Add-on Store, making it more accessible and easier to browse and search for add-ons.
* **Add-on installation telemetry:** Gathering anonymous data on add-on installations to understand usage patterns to help prioritise development efforts to improve the add-on ecosystem.
* **ARM installation telemetry:** Gathering anonymous data on ARM installations, providing insights into changing usage patterns.
* **Anonymous identifier:** Implementation of a system for generating unique, rotating, anonymous identifiers for NVDA installations, allowing for better data collection and analysis without compromising user privacy.
* **End of support for Windows 8.1, 2012/R2:** Officially ending support for older versions of Windows, allowing us to focus on developing for modern operating systems and their latest accessibility features.

## Long-Term Priorities

These priorities represent ambitious goals and initiatives that will shape the future of NVDA.

* **Integrated AI image description:** Free, secure, performant, private and VI-focussed AI image description available out of the box.
* **Secure add-on environment:** Building a more secure add-on ecosystem, protecting users from potentially malicious add-ons.
* **Magnifier prototype:** Exploring the development of a built-in screen magnification feature as a prototype, to better support our low-vision users.
* **Feature usage telemetry:** Implementing anonymous telemetry to track feature usage within NVDA, helping us understand how users interact with the software and identify areas for improvement.
* **Official training material for NVDA accessibility testers:** Developing comprehensive training materials for individuals interested in becoming NVDA accessibility testers, ensuring high-quality testing and feedback.
* **NVDA help AI chatbot prototype:** Exploring the development of an AI-powered chatbot to provide instant support and answer frequently asked questions about NVDA.
* **Automated C++ and markdown linting:** Implementing automated linting for C++ and Markdown files, further improving code quality and consistency within the project.
